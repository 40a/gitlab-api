## I want to contribute!
first off: you're a hero.  
If you want to contribute to this module, but are not sure where to start, look for [issues with a low weight](https://gitlab.com/tdemeester/GitLab-API/issues).
## How to report a bug
If you have found a bug please submit an issue to the [issuetracker](https://gitlab.com/tdemeester/GitLab-API/issues) and attach the label ```Type:Bug``` to the new issue.  
If it happens that you know the solution to an existing bug, please first open the issue in order to keep track of it and then open the relevant merge request that potentially fixes it.
## How to request an "enhancement"
To create a feature request for the API module please submit an issue to the [issuetracker](https://gitlab.com/tdemeester/GitLab-API/issues)
and assign the label ```Type:Enhancement``` to the issue.
If you feel like you can contribute to the enhancement please do so and open a relevant Merge Request when required.
## How to submit changes
I welcome Merge Requests with fixes and improvements to the module.
For feedback during development of the enhancement or fix please open an issue in Gitlab.
When ready please submit a Merge Request
